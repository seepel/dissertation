\section{Conclusion}
This thesis has presented the search for both the SM Higgs boson and the MSSM neutral Higgs bosons at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV with an integrated luminosity of $4.6$ fb$^{-1}$.
The measured data was found to be compatible with the background only hypothesis in all categories.
The upper limit on the SM Higgs boson was set to be approximately three times that predicted by the standard model. 
The upper limit on the cross section times branching ratio in the $H\rightarrow\tau\tau\rightarrow\mu\tau_{h}$ channel for the MSSM neutral Higgs boson was set and interpreted within the MSSM as an exclusion in the plane defined by $m_{A}$ and $tan\beta$.
